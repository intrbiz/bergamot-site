I’m happy to announce the first release of Bergamot Monitoring: V1.0.0 (Violet Club).  This release has been long overdue for a while now, and a few weeks ago the project passed the anniversary of it’s initial commit.  So finally, the time feels right.

While I hope this will be a somewhat mature version one release, it still represents a project in its early phases.  There are a good number of rough edges, however I think that the core of Bergamot Monitoring is stable and offers enough functionality to be usable.

From now on I'm aiming to release quarterly, or sooner if there are compelling features, if you don't want to dip your toes in the water just yet then stay tuned.

You can find RPMs and packages available on our [download page](/getit)
